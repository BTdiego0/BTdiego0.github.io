### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 4, part 2 I had a lot of fun doing this lab because we had to create a game and that was a unique experience especially because I love games. The game we had to create also reminded me of a web game named higher or lower. This lab made me work on my loops more specifically the if loops which I became increasingly better at due to this lab.
