### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 4, Part 2
  
  I had a lot of fun doing this lab because we had to create a game and that was a unique experience especially because I love games. The game we had to create also reminded me of a web game named higher or lower. This lab made me work on my loops more specifically the if loops which I became increasingly better at due to this lab.

* Lab 6, Part 1
  
  I enjoyed this lab because it reminded me of the self checkout machines at food places where you add your food and it calculates everything for you. I also learned a lot from this lab including how to properly add items after the ./ for an example ./sandwich spam white mustard. This lab also helped me understand command lines more because I was struggling in that area of functions.

* Lab 8, Part 2
  
  The uniqueness of this lab objective was what stood out to me because we made a pattern that was similar to that of knitting a clothing garment. When the program ran it was pretty and satisfying to see how the pattern came to life. I struggled a lot with for loops so this lab definitely helped me feel more comfortable using for loops. I also learned how to properly place functions such as i and ++i. Thanks to this lab I now feel more confident using these fucntions.
